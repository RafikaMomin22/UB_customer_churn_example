# Customer Churn Prediction Pipeline

This project provides a complete solution for predicting customer churn using machine learning. The pipeline includes data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL), model selection and training, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.

## Features

- Data loading and exploration
- Automated data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling, encoding)
- Multiple model comparison (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM)
- Hyperparameter tuning for the best performing model
- Comprehensive performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC AUC)
- Model serialization and loading
- Unit tests for all components

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Required packages:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - pytest (for testing)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-churn-prediction.git
   cd customer-churn-prediction
